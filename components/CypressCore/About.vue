        I have conducted dozens of workshops worldwide and have been teaching how to use Cypress since version 4.4.0. I do my best to take complex concepts and break them down into simple explanations. I make improvements and update this workshop regularly, so you will always get the latest and greatest. My goal is to provide attendees with a firm knowledge of the core principles that you can apply in your next job or next project.
