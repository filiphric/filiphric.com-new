      Who is this workshop for?
    </h3>
    <p class="text-xl">
      It is especially useful for testers, QAs and QA engineers that are starting with test automation or are migrating from another framework, such as Selenium. It can also be useful for frontend developers that would like to get to know Cypress

      Who is this workshop NOT for?
    </h3>
    <p class="text-xl">
      It‚Äôs definitely NOT suitable dor people that have no prior experience with web applications. If CSS, HTML and JavaScript are still foreign terms for you, it‚Äôs better to first catch up on the basics of these.

    </h3>

      It‚Äôs simple! Post the link to this workshop on Twitter, LinkedIn or other social network sharing that you will attend. You are more than welcome to tag me in the post üôÇ. You can then use the code CORE50 at checkout and apply the discount. I know there‚Äôs no real way for me to check if you really posted. But I trust you ‚ù§Ô∏è

      I‚Äôd like you to come and do a workshop in our company, is that possible?
    </h3>
    <p class="text-xl">
      Of course! I‚Äôm preparing an info page about this, but feel free to reach out to me and I‚Äôd be happy to give you more info

    <h3 class="mt-7 text-2xl font-extrabold">
      Will the workshop be recorded?
    </h3>
    <p class="text-xl">
      I don‚Äôt like to record workshop for various reasons. The main one is that a recording will not have the same value as when you attend the workshop yourself. You‚Äôll miss the practical examples, option to ask questions and interact with other attendees.
