I take your privacy seriously and am committed to protecting your personal information. This privacy policy explains how I collect, use, and store your data when you interact with my blog page.

## 1. Data Collection
I do not collect any personal data directly through my blog page. However, I use third-party services for analytics, payments, email marketing, and database management. These services may collect data as outlined below:

### 1.1. Plausible Analytics
I use [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io/) to gather anonymized information about how visitors interact with my website. Plausible does not collect personal data, use cookies, or track users across the web. All analytics data is aggregated and non-identifiable.

### 1.2. Stripe Payments
If you make a payment through my website, I use [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) as my payment processor. When you submit your payment details, the information is managed and stored by Stripe. I do not store any payment information on my servers. Stripe may collect personal information necessary for processing payments, such as your name, email address, and billing details. You can manage your payment information directly through Stripe.

For more details, please refer to [Stripe's Privacy Policy](https://stripe.com/privacy).

### 1.3. Supabase
I use [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) as my backend database service. Supabase may collect and store data necessary for the operation of my website, such as user authentication data and any information you provide when interacting with my services. Supabase processes this data in accordance with their privacy policy.

For more information, please refer to [Supabase's Privacy Policy](https://supabase.com/privacy).

## 2. Email Marketing
I use [Kit.com](https://kit.com/) (formerly ConvertKit) to manage my email marketing campaigns. If you opt-in to receive marketing emails, I will collect your name and email address. This information is stored securely by Kit.com, and you can unsubscribe from these communications at any time by following the instructions in the emails.

For more information on Kit.com's privacy practices, please refer to their [Privacy Policy](https://kit.com/privacy).

## 3. Data Usage
Payment Information: Any payment information provided during transactions is used solely for completing the transaction. It is managed by Stripe and will not be stored or used by me for any other purpose.
Marketing Data: I only send marketing emails if you explicitly consent to receiving them. You can withdraw consent at any time by unsubscribing.

## 4. Data Sharing
I do not sell, rent, or trade any personal information to third parties. I share your data only with the service providers mentioned above (Plausible Analytics, Stripe, Kit.com, Supabase), and they process the data in accordance with their own privacy policies.

## 5. Your Rights
Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), you have certain rights regarding your personal data, including:

- **Right to Access**: You can request a copy of your personal data held by my third-party services.
- **Right to Rectification**: You can ask to update or correct your information if it is inaccurate.
- **Right to Erasure**: You can request that I delete your personal data if it is no longer necessary for the purposes I collected it for. I commit to removing your data from my systems, including Supabase, within 30 days of your request.
- **Right to Restrict Processing**: You can ask me to limit how I use your data.
- **Right to Data Portability**: You can request that your data be transferred to another organization.
